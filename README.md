# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
### Step 1:
Get the input from the user.
### Step 2:
Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```python

def expo(x):
    for i in range(1):
        x = x ** 2
    print("Exponentiation of a given number:",x)
x = int(input())
expo(x)
```

## Output:
